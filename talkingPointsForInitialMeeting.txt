This text document is for us to add talking points for our initial meeting. Please sign off on them like I do below so we know who to look to for elaboration during the meeting.

Talking Points:

- [Ben] How should we manage task assignment and tracking? Manual or with Software? CanBan or agree who does what now?

- [Ben] Should we decide on loose roles based on our strengths or should everyone do a little bit of everything? 

- [Ben] How often should we check in like this? Should we do standups?

-[Ben] Should we push our branches upstream for review?

-[Ben] How comfortable is everyone with git? We have to use it for remote collaboration so it might be a good idea to get some practice in.
