This text document is for us to add talking points for our initial meeting. Please sign off on them like I do below so we know who to look to for elaboration during the meeting.

Talking Points:

- [Ben] How should we manage task assignment and tracking? Manual or with Software? CanBan or agree who does what now?

- [Ben] Should we decide on loose roles based on our strengths or should everyone do a little bit of everything? 

- [Ben] How often should we check in like this? Should we do standups?
