Talking Points:

- Bitbucket Hot Potato 
 Went super well, we are all git pros. Discussed and practiced using branching to make changes to the project and review before things are added to the final submission.

- Trello Setup
    We have a trello board set up for the first phase of the project. We have added appropriate tasks and will add specific tasks for use cases asynchronously as we discuss the project on slack. We also discussed a process for how we're going to complete, review, and merge completed deliverables into our bitbucket.

- Time Tracking
    We are going to be using a shared google doc for tracking hours. That doc is set up and the link is in slack.

- Project Breakdown
    We briefly discussed the content of the project and will be breaking it down further on Trello asynchronously.
