# ChocAn Data System

This was a semester long group project completed as part of CS200 - Software Engineering and Design at the University of Alabama. The pupose of this project is to serve as a data managment system for the fictional company ChocAn. The origional requirements document can be found in the top directory. This project utilized aspects of the Unified Process and makes extensive use of UML diagrams (found in report.html). 

## My Role in This Project

Throught each stage of the process I contributed to the software design, mostly involving drawing UML diagrams and meeting with other team members to discuss the diagrams. In the implementation phase, I wrote several of the source code files which are marked with @author Philip Thompson.
For a more detailed breakdown of my role in this project, there is a task distribution section in each report.html in /old.

## Usage

All necessary instructions should be found in manual/UserManual.pdf.
This project was most recently compiled with Java 14.

## Folder Structure

The project root is the src folder. This contains all source code. 
The doc folder contains all of the JavaDocs for the project.
The report.html in the top directory is the final state of the project before implementation.
The design folder contains the final UML class diagram for the project.
The old folder contains the state of the project at various phases in the design process.
